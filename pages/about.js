                Iâ€™m Joshua, a recent postgraduate from the Welingkar Institute of Management and a self-taught UX designer with a background in Banking and Insurance. I also do Front-End Web Development from time to time and know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. <br />
                <br /> My interests are Formula 1, PC Gaming and I also play the guitar. While learning web development during the lockdown, I developed an interest in User Experience, and dove head first into the world of UX design. Currently I am taking the Google UX Design course from Coursera.
